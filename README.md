# draculove
Draculove is a 2D dating sim demo made in Unity.

I created this project to learn the 2D asset pipeline for Unity. I designed all artwork in a 8-bit style and ensured clean, sharp pixels through Unity sprite asset importation. I also created scripts for switching between dialogue-led and 2D platformer styles of gameplay. The base for the dialogue system was created using Fungus (https://fungusgames.com/).

Since this game was made in 2019 for Mac and not updated since, it might have trouble being run and viewed in Unity on other and/or newer platforms. The gameplay preview of this game can be found here if the issue occurs: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbBRIxer0AA,
